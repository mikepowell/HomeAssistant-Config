# Lovelace component for confuring the UI.
#
# I use Lovelace  in both storage mode, but I add some additional dashboards
# manually in YAML mode. Reasoning for this is quite simple: I suck at UI stuff.
#
# This way, my main dashboard is controlled via the UI. This covers my main
# needs for the house quick and easy, while I slowly learn more about the
# purely YAML versions.
#
# Maybe somewhere in the future I can replace the storage managed dashboards
# with a YAML version, or, dunno, replace everything with storage versions.
